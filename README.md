# Lucas-Forbes-Projects
Projects and assignments completed or collaborated on by Lucas Forbes

This repository is compiled of different assignments, projects, and self study activities which I have had an influence on.
The two projects I am most proud of are the version of the game Brick Breaker and the point of sale system which could be used 
by a restaurant. 
While small in size, I am eager to learn more and contribute further.
